        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <hr>
        <h6>The task:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Using stores.json file and lion-test.psd (as the mock up):</li>
          <li>Implementation of the mockup as a full responsive template;</li>
          <li>Header should be fixed and links take you the sections of the page via scroll;</li>
          <li>A lightbox should be used to see the "instructions";</li>
          <li>The form should have validation;</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <span>For the places section, take this into account:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Show all the stores, only which their "status" is set to "true", into rows of 3</li>
          <li>Display unique "state" values as filters, at the top of the page (Note: must be done dynamically - do not
            hard code this);</li>
          <li>Implement filtering functionality on the state values, in which the stores of the same state as the
            filter, are loaded upon click [example: We have "California" shown as a state and hence a filter at the top
            of the page, once it is clicked, only the stores which their state is California are to be displayed];</li>
          <li>Whenever a filter is clicked for a second time (unselected), show all the valid stores again
            ("status":"true").</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <span class="bonus-points">Bonus Points:</span>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>Multi-filtering; in which multiple filters can be selected/unselected, and their stores are shown
            accordingly</li>
          <li>Sorting functionality; in which the stores are sorted alphabetically based on their names (Note: this is
            not included in the design, please use your own creativity to add this element to the page)</li>
          <li>Creativity with the mobile template.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>It has to be fully mobile responsive;</li>
          <li>Any plugin/framework can be used;</li>
          <li>Dynamic coding;</li>
          <li>It must work on the current versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge;</li>
          <li>Use of SASS as CSS pre-processor;</li>
          <li>Neat code, and comments where necessary.</li>
